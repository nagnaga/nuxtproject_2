            The shades were closed keeping the room dark. 
            Peter knew that he should open them and let in the sunlight so he could begin the day, but he didn't have the energy or willpower.
             Nothing had gone as expected the day before and he no longer wanted to spend the energy to begin a new day. 
            He stared at the shades wondering if there was a way to disappear from the reality of the world for the rest of the day.
